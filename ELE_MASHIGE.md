My name is Elekanyani Mashige, you can call me Ele. I'm currently based in Cape Town, my go to place mostly is Cape Town stadium, main reason is to watch soccer, i'm a huge soccer fan. Locally, i support Kaizer Chiefs, i support Chelsea in English League.
One thing i don't like to do is cook, it's just too much admin. but i definitely love eating food, my favourate meal is always samp and beef stew. Unfortunately it's not sold everywhere, so i have to cook it if i really want to eat it.
Check out my all time favourate song on this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KC0DNLDXJW8
One interesting thing about me is that i play FIFA very well.
